# Smart Healthcare System

## Problem Statement
- As the COVID situation prevailing in our country, people feel it unsafe to go to hospital for taking appointment and wait for useless hours.

- Often people don't want to visit hospital for any usual symptoms checkup or any uncomplicated medical issue.

- In this current situation there is a shortage of oxygen and plasma and also shortage of beds for patients in hospital.

## Solutions
- We can make a website where covid patients can checkup online by providing their symptoms and can also book a seat for doctor as well as hospital online in emergency cases.

- We can also create a portal with blood and oxygen distributors by which one can give notification whenever stock of plasma and oxygen will be available. By doing this we can handle the shortage of oxygen and plasma to a great extent.
